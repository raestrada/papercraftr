# Iterating Your Paper with PaperCraftr üìëüîÑ

Writing an academic paper is an iterative process. **PaperCraftr** not only helps you generate the initial structure and content, but it also enables you to **refine** and **enhance** your paper over time. Whether you need to review references, strengthen arguments, or adjust the structure of your sections, PaperCraftr has you covered.

## Automatic Refinement

Every command in PaperCraftr automatically refines the content of an existing file. If a file already exists, new content generated by PaperCraftr will **refine**, **update**, or **add to** the existing content without overwriting it entirely.

For example, if you've already generated a literature review and run the command again, it will **refine the existing review**, making it more detailed or adjusting it based on new input.

## Iterative Commands

### 1. Check and Fix References

As you expand your research, you may want to ensure that all references are accurate and consistent. This command **scans all sections** for reference accuracy, suggesting updates or providing a standardized format.

```bash
papercraftr iterate check-references "Ensure all references are formatted correctly."
```

To update a specific reference across the entire document:

```bash
papercraftr iterate fix-reference "Old Reference" "New Corrected Reference"
```

### 2. Refine Hypothesis and Research Questions

A strong research question and hypothesis are key to any paper. This command **refines your research questions or hypotheses**, ensuring clarity and alignment with your objectives.

```bash
papercraftr iterate refine-hypothesis "Clarify the hypothesis in the context of AI applications in cognitive psychology."
```

### 3. Strengthen Core Argument

The central argument or thesis of your paper may require refinement. This command will **reiterate and strengthen the argument** across sections to ensure it is clear and compelling.

```bash
papercraftr iterate strengthen-argument "Ensure the argument on AI's impact on cognitive processes is emphasized."
```

### 4. Insert Sections and Adjust Numbering

If you need to add a section, this command **inserts the new section** and **adjusts numbering** of all subsequent sections automatically.

```bash
papercraftr iterate insert-section 2 "Insert a section discussing recent developments in AI and cognitive science."
```

### 5. Split a Section

If a section becomes too dense, you can **split it into two separate sections**. This command will split the specified section and adjust numbering of all subsequent sections.

```bash
papercraftr iterate split-section 3 "Split this section to separately address methodology and analysis."
```

### 6. Add a Case Study or Example

Case studies and examples add depth to an argument. This command lets you **add a case study** within a specified section, ensuring seamless integration with the rest of the paper.

```bash
papercraftr iterate add-case-study 4 "Include a case study on AI‚Äôs application in cognitive behavior research."
```

### 7. Update Key Points in the Conclusion

Conclusion points are critical for reinforcing the importance of your work. Use this command to **update or refine key points** in the conclusion, making sure they align with recent adjustments in your paper.

```bash
papercraftr iterate update-conclusion "Highlight the potential applications of AI models in cognitive research."
```

### 8. Consistency Check Across All Sections

Before finalizing your paper, it‚Äôs essential to check for consistency across all sections. This command will **review the entire document** to ensure clarity and alignment in arguments, references, and methodology.

```bash
papercraftr iterate check-consistency "Ensure all terminology and research objectives are consistent throughout the paper."
```

## Iterating Efficiently

The power of **PaperCraftr** lies in its ability to help you **iterate** without losing track of your paper's overall structure. By running these commands after each major drafting session, you ensure that your paper develops into a cohesive and polished piece of research.

The iterative process in **PaperCraftr** aligns with principles of rigorous academic writing. These commands help ensure consistency, depth, and clarity‚Äîprinciples essential for any scholarly work.
